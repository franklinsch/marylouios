# Marylou iOS
Created by Franklin Schrans (iOS developer), Freddie Lindsey, Amin Karamlou (both back-end) in the context of the IC HACK 15' hackathon.

This is the backend implementation, used to crunch the data sent by the iOS app ([see repo here](https://github.com/franklinsch/marylouios))

## What is it?
Project Marylou, now named "Precisely", is an iOS app. It is _Your smartest, most personal travel planner_. When people want to go on vacation, they usually search for places and see if it matches their expectations. Precisely does the opposite: you enter the details (even _very_ detailed details) you're looking for in a vacation place, and we process the best matches of cities for you.

### Disclaimer
_This is Hackathon code._ It isn't particularly well written, it just had to work for the time of the demo.
Precisely uses the Bloomberg API, but unfortunately we don't have access to it anymore.
