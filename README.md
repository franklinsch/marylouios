# Precisely (Project Marylou)
Created by Franklin Schrans (iOS developer), Freddie Lindsey (NodeJS, Express, Server requests), Amin Karamlou (Server-side) in the context of the IC HACK 15' hackathon.

## Components

- Frontend (iOS) : Written in Swift
  - Collects data from our server using HTTP Requests and JSON (De-)Serialization
  - Shows the results as per user parameters using Apple Maps
- Server : NodeJS using the Express framework ([link](http://github.com/franklinsch/marylou))

## What is it?
Project Marylou, now named "Precisely" is _Your smartest, most personal travel planner_. When people want to go on vacation, they usually search for places and see if it matches their expectations. Precisely does the opposite: you enter the details (even _very_ detailed details) you're looking for in a vacation place, and we process the best matches of cities for you.
